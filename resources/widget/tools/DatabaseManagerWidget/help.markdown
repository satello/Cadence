A collection of input and output functions for trackway data.

Save

Saves track data modified within Maya to your local database.

Load
----
Loads track data from your local database into Maya for display.

Import
------
Allows you to select a CSV spreadsheet of track data, in the official A16 column arrangement, to be imported and saved in the database. If the overwrite option is checked existing database entries will be overwritten if by spreadsheet entries for the same track. If overwrite is not checked, spreadsheet entries for tracks already in the database will be ignored.

Export
------
Writes the current database tracks to a CSV spreadsheet file in a hybrid format compatible with the A16 format, but annotated with additional track information stored exclusively in the database.
